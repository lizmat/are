DESCRIPTION
===========

The `are` subroutine (the only subroutine exported by this module) returns the most common class or role from a list of objects.

It was introduced in Rakudo release 2022.01 as a method on `Any`. It is provided here to allow the functionality to be used with older versions of Rakudo.
